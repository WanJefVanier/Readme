Hello whoever is reading this! My name is Jeff. I am a grade 12 student. 

During my time in our school, I have decent knowledge and experience with two coding languages which include Pascal and Turing, and very limited knowledge on Python and C++ as I have done projects with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis in our Computer Engineering Class.
Some experiences with code include creating a database, a game, and algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)

Languages I feel comfortable with are Pascal and Turing as I have good enough knowlege on how they operate and function to accomplish a certain task.

I am currently applying to universities for Computer Science, yet I do not know what my future aspirations would be since I am conflicted on what I really want to do in the future. Something on the top of my head would be doing something special and unique to improve my problem solving skills and critical thinking. 

What I like best about computer programming is that it really makes you think and challenges you to achieve your goal. It trains your critical thinking and problem solving as it allows you to write a program based on your own thought processes. 

What I dislike the most about computer programming is that it is very time consuming and although I do enjoy the challenge of programming, when something does not work the way I intend it to can frustrate me. An example could have been me trying to fix the error trapping in my database and improper syntaxing which can lead to a lot of time wasted.
